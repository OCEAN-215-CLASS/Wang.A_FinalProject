- This project is about the impact of sea temperature change on the abuncance of salmons.The hypothesis is that the increase in sea temperature will decrease the abundance of salmons. The results show that the temperature did not increase in average obviously although the abundance of salmons indeed decreased. It fails to support the hypothesis.
